  - speaker: 
    text: The forest gets much denser and in places you struggle to find the path
      amoung the underbrush.
  - speaker: 
    text: Still, you forge on, until you notice a plume of some a small distance
      away along the path.
  - speaker: 
    text: Getting closer, you see a primitive wooden hut with a much smaller house
      beside it, and a goblin sitting at a campfire, eating a handful of berries
      and nuts off of a metal plate.
  - speaker: 
    text: You seem to have startled the goblin, who recognises your armour and almost
      falls over getting up, before rushing to the small house and checking inside.
  - speaker: 
    text: He quickly grabs a shoddy-looking spear and shield from the larger hut
      before confronting you.
