  - speaker: Goblin
    text: Sorry, human, I seem to have misjudged you. Perhaps you were merely acting
      in self-defense earlier, and now I am the monster for attacking you for it.
  - speaker: Goblin
    text: As compensation, please allow me to guide you through the next part of
      the forest. It's incredibly dense and you'd need a miracle to get through by
      yourself.
  - speaker: 
    text: After paying another quick visit to the small house, the goblin leads the
      way through the dense foliage for what feels like hours.
  - speaker: 
    text: Eventually, you see the light of a clearing up ahead, marking the area
      surrounding the Tower of Darkness.
