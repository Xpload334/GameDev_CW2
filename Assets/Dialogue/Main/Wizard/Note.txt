Quick note on Wizard dialogue:

Depending on when you want portraits and stuff to appear (triggered via a UnityEvent) split the Dialogue objects.
This way you can have lists of dialogue and still dynamically trigger events.

e.g.
For an intro_1 you can start with the Goblin and the Hero talking.
Then using an event, make the portraits disappear.
Then start intro_2
Then using an event, make the portrait change
Then start intro_3 with the wizard talking
